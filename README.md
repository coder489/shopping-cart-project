## Description

A program that can be used by a cashier at a grocery store to create a receipt consisting of products identified by inputed ID numbers

  
## Installation

Create a new repository and enter its respository name, such as shopping-cart-project

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

Then navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/shopping-cart-project
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "shopping-env":

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate shopping-env
```

## Setup

In in the root directory of your local repository, create a new file that ends with .py, such as shopping_cart.py

## Packages to Install

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
```
