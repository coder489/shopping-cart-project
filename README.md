## Description

A program that can be used by a cashier at a grocery store to create a receipt consisting of products identified by inputed ID numbers

  
## Installation

Create a new repository and enter its respository name, such as shopping-cart-project

After creating the remote repo, use GitHub Desktop software or the command-line to download or "clone" it onto your computer. Choose a familiar download location like the Desktop.

Then navigate there from the command line (subsequent commands assume you are running them from the local repository's root directory):

```sh
cd ~/Desktop/shopping-cart-project
```

Use Anaconda to create and activate a new virtual environment, perhaps called "shopping-env":

```sh
conda create -n shopping-env python=3.7 # (first time only)
conda activate shopping-env
```

## Packages to Install

```sh
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Usage

To run the script, use the following command:

```
python app/shopping_cart.py
```

## Testing

From inside the virtual environment that was created, use the following code to install testing capabilities

```
pip install pytest
```

Use the following code to run the tests:

```
pytest
```
